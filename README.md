# Overview

The OxSR package calculates the ratio between hematite and goethite
oxides in soil via diffuse reflectance.

In soil science, understanding the mineral composition is often a
starting point for research in various areas.

Iron oxides are widely studied and play a role in a range of studies,
from fertilization and nutrient dynamics to contamination and
sustainable practices.

Techniques for determining these minerals are often expensive and
time-consuming. Therefore, practical, rapid, and sensitive methods such
as diffuse reflectance in the visible spectrum have gained importance.
This technique can also be used to determine soil color, another
parameter that helps in understanding the environment.
